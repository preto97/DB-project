# DB-project

During the Database course I created a personal and a unique project into MySQL to expand my acquired knowledge. 
Into the project I created 5 tables interrelated, each of them holding a different information according to the table name. 
The project describes a library which keeps track of borrowed/unborrowed books as well as of customers.
